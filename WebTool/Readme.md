# ioTools - WebTool

This directory contains simple WebApp tool. Right now its only function is browsing documentation of the MD and AI scripting. More features will be added in the future, according to my or community demands.

## How to use?

Extract the WebTool to the main folder of properly unpacked game files. If using my XRCatTool scripts to unpack the game data you can just copy all content from the WebTool folder to the "_unpacked" directory created by the xrcattool_unpack_01_09.bat script.

# ioTools - XRCatTool Scripts

This directory contains automation for unpacking game files.

## How to use?

Extract scripts to the main X4:Foundations game folder. Run xrcattool__setpath.bat with administrator privileges to setup X Tools main executable location to XRCATTOOL_PATH system environment variable. Then run desired script from this directory.
Default settings are no-brainer which expects that game is installed on same drive as X Tools both via Steam. Script will ask for the path of X Tools but you can leave it empty to use default location ("../X Tools" from the X4:Foundations installation folder).
